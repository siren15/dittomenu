# dittomenu
source: https://store.kde.org/p/2167594 (was not able to find a repo for plasma 6 version, otherwise would for that)
a little modified version of the Plasma 6 version of dittomenu by [adhe](https://github.com/adhec)

It also fixes a few things from the pling store version, like adds back rounded user icon, and adds session management buttons, and fixes them by not using original pmEngine and instead uses plasma session management api.
